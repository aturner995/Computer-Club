Plan for Computer Club Week 1 (TUES 24 JUL 12 - 1:00 pm)
========================================================

## Welcome To Computer Club ##
1. Plan on Learning Programming for the club over the next few terms
2. During Term III we'll learn Python (Programming Language)
3. During Term IV we'll write a major project amongst the whole group (start thinking of ideas)
4. By the end of this term, you will be fairly proficient in a major programming language (python), enough so you are capable of continuing learning yourself, or learn another language, as you will understand many of the difficult concepts

## Introductions ##
1. Introduce Leaders: Will, Alex and Patrick
2. Get an idea of technicality of Users and Names (eg: Who's programmed before, what in? What OS do you run?)


## Introduction to Programming and Python ##
1. Programming is About Instructing a computer to do what you want. At this level, that's inserting data into memory and performing operations on that data.
2. Python is an interpreted language (No need to compile, done on the fly) which has risen to importance recently (past decade). 
   i. Very easy to learn
   ii. Excellent documentation
   iii. Used By: NASA, Google (a lot), Yahoo!, Battlefield II, IBM, etc.

## Installing Python and Getting Setup - http://python.org/download/ ##
1. We're using Python2, because nobody likes 3
2. Show windows installer
3. Macs have python by default but you should update to 2.7 by using the Mac installer
4. *Nix/Solaris: Can compile from source or should be in 99% of repos

## Running Python ##
1. Show interpreter: "Hello World"
2. Show how to launch files (using text editor and launch with python filename.py)

## An Introduction to Assignment and Variables (if Time) ##
1. simple a = 1, etc.

# For Next Week: #
1. Setup Python at home. Work out how to both use the interpreter and launch files
2. Read Through: https://github.com/pocon/Computer-Club/tree/master/Week%201/Tutorial%20Walkthrough
