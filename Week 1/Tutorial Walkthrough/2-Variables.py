A Basic Run Through Assignment and variables

'''

# Strings (A set of words or phrases)

text = 'Hello World' # This 'assigns' the variable text as 'Hello World'. That is, text is set to now refer to 'Hello World', as x = 3 in maths means that x has the value of 3
text = "Hello World" # A string can be contained in double or single quotes, it doesn't matter

print text # This prints the contents of the variable 'text', or displays them on the console

# Integers (Whole Numbers)

number = 10
print number

# Floating Point Numbers (Like Decimals)

number = 10.1
print number
